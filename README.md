# Crosshair Cursors

This is a set of crosshair cursors for the X window manager (may work with wayland as well?). Either way, this will only work on Linux desktops.

I can't figure out how to take a screenshot with my cursor in it, but here are the icons:
![active](img/active.png)
![default](img/default.png)
![problem](img/problem.png)
