# Crosshair Cursors

This is a set of crosshair cursors for the X window manager (may work with wayland as well?). Either way, this will only work on Linux desktops.

I can't figure out how to take a screenshot with my cursor in it, but here are the icons:
![active](img/active.png)
![default](img/default.png)
![problem](img/problem.png)

## Usage

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Dworv/crosshair-cursor/releases/tag/v0.5) in the releases tab and download `crosshair-cursors.tar.gz`.
2. Unzip the file into `~/.icons` or  `/usr/share/icons`
